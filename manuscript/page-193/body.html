<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">see now, with eyes made clear by knowledge, that everything
is governed by Universal Law-that the infinite number of laws are but
manifestations of the One Great Law-the LAW which is THE ALL. It is true
indeed that not a sparrow drops unnoticed by the Mind of THE AL—that
even the hairs on our head are numbered—as the scriptures have said
There is nothing outside of Law; nothing that happens contrary to it.
And yet, do not make the mistake of supposing that Man is but a blind
automaton-far from that. The Hermetic Teachings are that Man may use Law
to overcome laws, and that the higher will always prevail against the
lower, until at last he has reached the stage in which he seeks refuge
in the LAW itself, and laughs the phenomenal laws to scorn. Are you able
to grasp the inner meaning of this?</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
