understands this truth, hath come great knowledge." And, this being so,
let us seek this truth, the understanding of which means so much. In
this statement of truth—this Hermetic Maxim—is concealed one of the

the Universe—the truth that "the Universe is Mental—held in the Mind
of THE ALL." As the Kybalion says, in the passage quoted above: "All is
in THE ALL." But note also the co-related statement, that: "It is
equally true that THE ALL is in ALL." This apparently contradictory
statement is reconcilable under the Law of Paradox. It is, moreover, an
exact Hermetic statement of the relations existing between THE ALL and
its Mental Universe. We have seen how "All is in THE ALL"—now let us
examine the other aspect of the subject.</p></div> </div>
