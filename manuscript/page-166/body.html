of a certain mental state, may be communicated to another person, and
his polarity in that class of mental states thus changed. It is along
this principle that the results of many of the "mental treatments" are
obtained. For instance, a person is "blue," melancholy and full of fear.
A mental scientist bringing his own mind up to the desired vibration by
his trained will, and thus obtaining the desired polarization in his own
case, then produces a similar mental state in the other by induction,
the result being that the vibrations are raised and the person polarizes
toward the Positive end of the scale instead toward the Negative, and
his Fear and other negative emotions are transmuted to Courage and
similar positive mental states. A little study will show you that these
mental changes are nearly all along the line of Polarization, the change
being one of degree rather than of kind.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A knowledge of the existence of this great Hermetic</p></div> </div>
