mental states are subject to the same Law. The man who enjoys keenly, is
subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable
of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and
enjoys but littleâ€”he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are
other animals who enjoy keenly, but whose nervous organism and
temperament cause them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is
with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of
enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are others
which permit the most intense enjoyment, but also the most intense
suffering.</p></div> </div>
