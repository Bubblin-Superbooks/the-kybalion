physics, or material things, forces, and manifestations. It includes all
forms of that which we call Matter, and all forms of that which we call
Energy or Force. But you must remember that the Hermetic Philosophy does
not recognize Matter as a thing in itself, or as having a separate
existence even in the Mind of THE ALL. The Teachings are that Matter is
but a form of Energyâ€”.that is, Energy at a low rate of vibrations of a
certain kind. And accordingly the Hermetists classify Matter under the
head of Energy, and give to it three of the Seven Minor Planes of the
Great Physical Plane.</p><p>These Seven Minor Physical Planes are as follows:</p><ol><li>The Plane of Matter (A)</li><li>The Plane of Matter (B)</li><li>The Plane of Matter (C)</li><li>The Plane of Ethereal Substance</li></ol></div> </div>
