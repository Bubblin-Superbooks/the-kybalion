differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind,
and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From
THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all
is in vibration—the higher the vibration, the higher the position in
the scale. The vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of
intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest—just as a rapidly
moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale,
there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem
at rest. Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of
varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and
molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion.
This is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but
