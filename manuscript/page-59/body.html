Power—some Substantial Reality.</p><p>All thinkers, in all lands and in all times, have assumed the necessity
for postulating the existence of this Substantial Reality. All
philosophies worthy of the name have been based upon this thought. Men
have given to this Substantial Reality many names-some have called it by
the term of Deity (under many titles). Others have called it "The
Infinite and Eternal Energy" others have tried to call it "Matter"—but
all have acknowledged its existence. It is self-evident it needs no

greatest thinkers, both ancient and modern—the Hermetic. Masters—and
