Twentieth Century scientific discoveries have added additional proof of
the correctness and truth of this centuries-old Hermetic doctrine.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Hermetic Teachings are that not only is everything in constant
movement and vibration, but that the "differences" between the various
manifestations of the universal power are due entirely to the varying
rate and mode of vibrations. Not only this, but that even THE ALL, in
itself, manifests a constant vibration of such an infinite degree of
intensity and rapid motion that it may be practically considered as at
rest, the teachers directing the attention of the students to the fact
that even on the physical plane a rapidly moving object (such as a
revolving wheel) seems to be at rest. The Teachings are to the effect
that Spirit is at one end of the Pole of Vibration, the other Pole being
certain extremely gross forms of Matter. Between these two poles are
millions upon millions of different rates</p></div> </div>
