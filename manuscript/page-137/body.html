<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Spiritual Plane,
what shall we say? How can we explain these higher states of Being, Life
and Mind, to minds as yet unable to grasp and understand the higher
subdivisions of the Plane of Human Mind? The task is impossible. We can
speak only in the most general terms. How may Light be described to a
man born blind—how sugar, to a man who has never tasted anything
sweet—how harmony, to one born deaf?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">All that we can say is that the Seven Minor Planes of the Great
Spiritual Plane (each Minor Plane having its seven sub-divisions)
comprise Beings possessing Life, Mind and Form as far above that of Man
of to-day as the latter is above the earth-worm, mineral or even certain
forms of Energy or Matter. The Life of these Beings so far transcends
ours, that we cannot even think of the details of the same; their minds
so far transcend ours, that to them we scarcely seem to "think," and our
mental processes seem almost akin to material processes;</p></div> </div>
