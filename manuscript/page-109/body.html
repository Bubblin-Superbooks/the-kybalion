This process is believed by the Hermetists to have a Correspondence to
the mental process of an artist, writer, or inventor, who becomes so
wrapped up in his mental creation as to almost forget his own existence
and who, for the time being, almost "lives in his creation," If instead
of "wrapped" we use the word "rapt," perhaps we will give a better idea
of what is meant.</p><p>This Involuntary stage of Creation is sometimes called the "Outpouring"
of the Divine Energy, just as the Evolutionary state is called the
"Indrawing." The extreme pole of the Creative process is considered to
be the furthest removed from THE ALL, while the beginning of the
Evolutionary stage is regarded as the beginning of the return swing of
the pendulum of Rhythmâ€”a "coming home" idea being held in all of the
Hermetic Teachings.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Teachings are that during the "Outpouring,"</p></div> </div>
