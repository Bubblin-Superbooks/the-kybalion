manifestations of life and mentality which are common to Man, in his
various grades, degrees, and divisions. In this connection, we wish to
point out the fact that the average man of today occupies but the fourth
sub-division of the Plane of Human Mind, and only the most intelligent
have crossed the borders of the Fifth Sub-Division. It has taken the
race millions of years to reach this stage, and it will take many more
years for the race to move on to the sixth and seventh sub-divisions,
and beyond. But, remember, that there have been races before us</p></div> </div>
