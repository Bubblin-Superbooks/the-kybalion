is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. So "heat" and "cold"
are simply the "two poles" of that which we call "Heat"—and the
phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of
Polarity. The same Principle manifests in the case of "Light and
Darkness," which are the same thing, the difference consisting of
varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does
"darkness" leave off, and "light" begin? What is the difference between
"Large and Small"? Between "Hard and Soft"? Between "Black and White"?
Between "Sharp and Dull"? Between "Noise and Quiet"? Between "High and
Low"? Between "Positive and Negative"? The Principle of Polarity
explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can</p></div> </div>
