<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Mental Creation.</p><p>Following the Principle of Correspondence, we are justified in
considering that THE ALL creates the Universe MENTALLY, in a manner akin
to the process whereby Man creates Mental Images. And, here is where the
report of Reason tallies precisely with the report of the Illumined, as
shown by their teachings and writings. Such are the teachings of the
Wise Men. Such was the Teaching of Hermes.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">THE ALL can create in no other way except mentally, without either using
material (and there is none to use), or else reproducing itself (which
is also impossible). There is no escape from this conclusion of the
Reason, which, as we have said, agrees with the highest teachings of the
Illumined. Just as you, student, may create a Universe of your own in
your mentality, so does THE ALL create Universes in its own Mentality.
But your Universe is the mental creation of a Finite</p></div> </div>
