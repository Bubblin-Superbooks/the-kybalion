Mental," which means that the Underlying Reality of the Universe is
Mind; and the Universe itself is Mentalâ€”that is, "existing in the Mind

to transmute mental conditions must render the Master the controller of
material conditions as well as those ordinarily called "mental."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As a matter of fact, none but advanced Mental</p></div> </div>
