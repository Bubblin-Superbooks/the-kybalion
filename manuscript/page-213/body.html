<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">"men consist of three partsâ€”soul, body and clothes." These
"clothes conscious" people would lose their personality if divested of
their clothing by savages upon the occasion of a shipwreck. But even
many who are not so closely bound up with the idea of personal raiment
stick closely to the consciousness of their bodies being their "Me" They
cannot conceive of a Self independent of the body. Their mind seems to
them to be practically "a something belonging to" their body-which in
many cases it is indeed.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But as man rises in the scale of consciousness he is able to disentangle
his "Me" from his idea of body, and is able to think of his body as
"belonging to" the mental part of him. But even then he is very apt to
identify the "Me" entirely with the mental states, feelings, etc., which
he feels to exist within him. He is very apt to consider these internal
states as identical with himself, instead of their being simply "things"
produced by some</p></div> </div>
