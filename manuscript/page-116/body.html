<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Strictly speaking, there cannot be said to be any "Reason" whatsoever
for THE ALL to act, for a "reason" implies a "cause," and THE ALL is
above Cause and Effect, except when it Wills to become a Cause, at which
time the Principle is set into motion. So, you see, the matter is
Unthinkable, just as THE ALL is Unknowable. Just as we say THE ALL
merely "IS"—so we are compelled to say that "THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT
ACTS." At the last, THE ALL is All Reason in Itself; All Law in Itself;
All Action in Itself—and it may be said, truthfully, that THE ALL is
Its Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act—or still further, that THE
ALL; Its Reason; Its Act; is Law; are ONE, all being names for the same
thing. In the opinion of those who are giving you these present lessons,
the answer is locked up in the INNER SELF of THE ALL, along with its
Secret of Being. The Law of Correspondence, in our opinion, reaches only
to that</p></div> </div>
