Ethereal Substance is a connecting link between the forms of vibratory
energy known as "Matter" on the one hand, and "Energy or Force" on the
other; and also that it manifests a degree of vibration, in rate and

or cylinder, to show the effects of increasing rates of vibration. The
illustration supposes a wheel, top, or revolving cylinder, running at a
low rate of speedâ€”we will call this revolving thing "the object" in
following out the illustration. Let us suppose the object moving slowly.
It may be seen readily, but no sound of its movement reaches the ear.
The speed is gradually increased. In a few moments its movement becomes
