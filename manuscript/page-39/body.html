of the Hermetic formulas. "Good and Evil" are but the poles of the same
thing, and the Hermetist understands the art of transmuting Evil into
Good, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short,
the "Art of Polarization" becomes a phase of "Mental Alchemy" known and

of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as
that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master
the art.</p><ol><li>The Principle of Rhythm
"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides;
all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in
everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the
measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates."â€”The
Kybalion.</li></ol></div> </div>
