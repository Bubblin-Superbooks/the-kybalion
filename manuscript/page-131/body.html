<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">body is but his material form and not "himself." These
entities may be called "souls" in one sense, and are living beings of a
low degree of development, life, and mindâ€”just a little more than the
units of "living energy" which comprise the higher sub-divisions of the
highest Physical Plane. The average mind does not generally attribute
the possession of mind, soul, or life, to the mineral kingdom, but all
occultists recognize the existence of the same, and modern science is
rapidly moving forward to the point-of-view of the Hermetic, in this
respect. The molecules, atoms and corpuscles have their "loves and
hates"; "likes and dislikes"; "attractions and repulsions". "affinities
and non-affinities," etc., and some of the more daring of modern
scientific minds have expressed the opinion that the desire and will,
emotions and feelings, of the atoms differ only in degree from those of
men. We have no time or space to argue this matter here. All</p></div> </div>
