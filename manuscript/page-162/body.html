"more love," or "less hate," as we ascend the scale; and "more hate" or
"less love" as we descend this being true no matter from what point,
high or low, we may start. There are degrees of Love and Hate, and there
is a middle point where "Like and Dislike" become so faint that it is
difficult to distinguish between them. Courage and Fear come under the

thing you find its opposite-the two poles.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And it is this fact that enables the Hermetist to transmute one mental
state into another, along the lines of Polarization. Things belonging to
different classes cannot be transmuted into each other, but things of
the same class may be changed, that is, may have their polarity changed.
Thus Love never becomes East or West, or Red or Violet-but it may and
often does turn into Hate and likewise Hate may be transformed</p></div> </div>
