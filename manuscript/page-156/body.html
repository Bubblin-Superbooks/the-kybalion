Transmutation, one of the branches of the Hermetic Art.</p><p>A little reflection on what we have said will show the student that the
Principle of Vibration underlies the wonderful phenomena of the power
manifested by the Masters and Adepts, who are able to apparently set
aside the Laws of Nature, but who, in reality, are simply using one law
against another; one principle against others; and who accomplish their
results by changing the vibrations of material objects, or forms of
energy, and thus perform what are commonly called "miracles."</p><p>As one of the old Hermetic writers has truly said: "He who understands
the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of Power."</p><hr class="section"><h5>Chapter X</h5></div> </div>
