<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Feminine corpuscle unites
with a Masculine corpuscle, a certain process is begun. The Feminine
particles vibrate rapidly under the influence of the Masculine energy,
and circle rapidly around the latter. The result is the birth of a new
atom. This new atom is really composed of a union of the Masculine and
Feminine electrons, or corpuscles, but when the union is formed the atom
is a separate thing, having certain properties, but no longer
manifesting the property of free electricity. The process of detachment
or separation of the Feminine electrons is called "ionization." These
electrons, or corpuscles, are the most active workers in Nature's field.
Arising from their unions, or combinations, manifest the varied
phenomena of light, heat, electricity, magnetism, attraction,
repulsion, chemical affinity and the reverse, and similar phenomena. And
all this arises from the operation of the Principle of Gender on the
plane of Energy.</p></div> </div>
