noticed that there is ever the Outpouring and the Indrawing; the
"Outbreathing and Inbreathing of Brahm," as the Brahmans word it.
Universes are created; reach their extreme low point of materiality; and
then begin in their upward swing. Suns spring into being, and then their
height of power being reached, the process of retrogression begins, and
after aeons they become dead masses of matter, awaiting another impulse
which starts again their inner energies into activity and a new solar
life cycle is begun. And thus it is with all the worlds; they are born,
grow and die; only to be reborn. And thus it is with all the things of
shape and form; they swing from action to reaction; from birth to death;
from activity to inactivity—and then back again. Thus it is with all
living things; they are born, grow, and die—and then are reborn. So it
is with all great movements, philosophies, creeds,</p></div> </div>
