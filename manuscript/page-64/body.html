all, informs us as follows regarding THE ALL, and that without

   not be THE ALL.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">(2) THE ALL must be INFINITE, for there is nothing else
   to define, confine, bound, limit; or restrict THE ALL.
   It must be Infinite in Time, or ETERNAL,—it must have
   always continuously existed, for there is nothing else to
   have ever created it, and something can never evolve from
   nothing, and if it had ever "not been," even for a moment,
   it would not "be" now,—it must continuously exist forever,
   for there is nothing to destroy it, and it can never
   "not-be," even for a moment, because something can never
   become nothing. It must be Infinite in Space—it must be
   Everywhere, for there is no place outside of THE ALL—it
   cannot be otherwise</p></div> </div>
