Transmutation of one kind of Mental Vibrations into others, instead of
the changing of one kind of metal into another. The legends of the
"Philosopher's Stone" which would turn base metal into Gold, was an
allegory relating to Hermetic Philosophy, readily understood by all
students of true Hermeticism.</p><p>In this little book, of which this is the First Lesson, we invite our
students to examine into the Hermetic Teachings, as set forth in THE
KYBALION, and as explained by ourselves, humble students of the
Teachings, who, while bearing the title of Initiates, are still students
at the feet of HERMES, the Master. We herein give you many of the
maxims, axioms and precepts of THE KYBALION, accompanied by explanations
and illustrations which we deem likely to render the teachings more
easily comprehended by the modern student, particularly as the original
text is purposely veiled in obscure terms.</p></div> </div>
