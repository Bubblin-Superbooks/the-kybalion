<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Divine Paradox</h3><p class=" stretch-last-line start-chapter">"The half-wise, recognizing the comparative unreality of
   the Universe, imagine that they may defy its Lawsâ€”such
   are vain and presumptuous fools, and they are broken against
   the rocks and torn asunder by the elements by reason of
   their folly. The truly wise, knowing the nature of the Universe,
   use Law against laws; the higher against the lower; and by
   the Art of Alchemy transmute that which is undesirable into
   that which is worthy, and thus triumph. Mastery consists not
   in abnormal dreams, visions and fantastic imaginings or
   living, but in using the higher forces</p></div> </div>
