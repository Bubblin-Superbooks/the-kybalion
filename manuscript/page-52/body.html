<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Alchemists have been able
to attain the degree of power necessary to control the grosser physical
conditions, such as the control of the elements of Nature; the
production or cessation of tempests; the production and cessation of
earthquakes and other great physical phenomena. But that such men have
existed, and do exist today, is a matter of earnest belief to all
advanced occultists of all schools. That the Masters exist, and have
these powers, the best teachers assure their students, having had
experiences which justify them in such belief and statements. These
Masters do not make public exhibitions of their powers, but seek
seclusion from the crowds of men, in order to better work their may
along the Path of Attainment. We mention their existence, at this point,
merely to call your attention to the fact that their power is entirely
Mental, and operates along the lines of the higher Mental Transmutation,
under the Hermetic Principle of Mentalism.</p></div> </div>
