<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">two-poles manifest on the physical, mental or
spiritual planes. The Principle of rhythm is closely connected with the
Principle of Polarity described in the preceding chapter. Rhythm
manifests between the two poles established by the Principle of
Polarity. This does not mean, however, that the pendulum of Rhythm
swings to the extreme poles, for this rarely happens; in fact, it is
difficult to establish the extreme polar opposites in the majority of
cases. But the swing is ever "toward" first one pole and then the other.</p><p>There is always an action and reaction; an advance and a retreat; a
rising and a sinking; manifested in all of the airs and phenomena of the
Universe. Suns, worlds, men, animals, plants, minerals, forces, energy,
mind and matter, yes, even Spirit, manifests this Principle. The
Principle manifests in the creation and destruction of worlds; in the
rise and fall of nations; in the life history of all things; and finally
in the mental states of Man.</p></div> </div>
