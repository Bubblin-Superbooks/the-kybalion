times, as well as of those illumined souls who have reached higher
planes of being, both of whom assert that the inner nature of THE ALL is

speculations of the theologians and metaphysicians regarding the inner
nature of THE ALL, as but the childish efforts of mortal minds to grasp
the secret of the Infinite. Such efforts have always failed and will
always fail, from the very nature of the task. One pursuing such
inquiries travels around and around in the labyrinth of thought, until
he is lost to all sane reasoning, action or conduct,</p></div> </div>
