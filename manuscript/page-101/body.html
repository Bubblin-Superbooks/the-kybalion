Life is not known to men on this plane .if, indeed, to any—but the
highest authorities, and our own intuitions, teach us that we will make
no mistake in living up to the best that is in us, so far as is
possible, and realising the Universal tendency in the same direction in
spite of apparent evidence to the contrary. We are all on The Path—and
the road leads upward ever, with frequent resting places.</p><p>Read the message of The Kybalion—and follow the example of "the
wise"—avoiding the mistake of "the half-wise" who perish by reason of
their folly.</p><hr class="section"><h5>Chapter Vii</h5></div> </div>
