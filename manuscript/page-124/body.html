highest manifestation, to the lowest, everything and all things Vibrate.
Not only do they vibrate at different rates of motion, but as in
different directions and in a different manner. The degrees of the rate
of vibrations constitute the degrees of measurement on the Scale of
Vibrationsâ€”in other words the degrees of the Fourth Dimension. And
these degrees form what occultists call "Planes" The higher the degree
of rate of vibration, the higher the plane, and the higher the
manifestation of Life occupying that plane. So that while a plane is not
"a place," nor yet "a state or condition," yet it possesses qualities
common to both. We shall have more to say regarding the subject of the
scale of Vibrations in our next lessons, in which we shall consider the
Hermetic Principle of Vibration.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">You will kindly remember, however, that the Three Great Planes are not
actual divisions of the phenomena</p></div> </div>
