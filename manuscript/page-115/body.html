<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">instinct" would be the Absolute, instead of THE ALL, and so
accordingly that part of the proposition falls. And, yet, THE ALL does
create and manifest, and seems to find some kind of satisfaction in so
doing. And it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in some
infinite degree it must have what would correspond to an "inner nature,"
or "creative instinct," in man, with correspondingly infinite Desire and
Will. It could not act unless it Willed to Act; and it would not Will to
Act, unless it Desired to Act and it would not Desire to Act unless it
obtained some Satisfaction thereby. And all of these things would belong
to an "Inner Nature," and might be postulated as existing according to
the Law of Correspondence. But, still, we prefer to think of THE ALL as
acting entirely FREE from any influence, internal as well as external.
That is the problem which lies at the root of difficultyâ€”and the
difficulty that lies at the root of the problem.</p></div> </div>
