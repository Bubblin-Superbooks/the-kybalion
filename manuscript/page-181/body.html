   everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a
   name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of
   causation, but nothing escapes the Law."—The Kybalion.</p><p>The great Sixth Hermetic Principle—the Principle of Cause and
Effect—embodies the truth that Law pervades the Universe; that nothing
happens by Chance; that Chance is merely a term indicating cause
existing but not recognized or perceived; that phenomena is continuous,
without break or exception.</p></div> </div>
