molecules of which the particular kinds of Matter are composed are in a
state of constant vibration and movement around each other and against
each other. The molecules are composed of Atoms, which, likewise, are in
a state of constant movement and vibration. The atoms are composed of
Corpuscles, sometimes called "electrons," "ions," etc., which also are
in a state of rapid motion, revolving around each other, and which
manifest a very rapid state and mode of vibration. And, so we see that
all forms of Matter manifest Vibration, in accordance with the Hermetic
Principle of Vibration.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And so it is with the various forms of Energy. Science teaches that
Light, Heat, Magnetism and Electricity are but forms of vibratory motion
connected in some way with, and probably emanating from the Ether.
