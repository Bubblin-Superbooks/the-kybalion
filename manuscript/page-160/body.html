thermometer where heat ceases and cold begins. It is all a matter of
higher or lower vibrations. The very terms "high" and "low," which we
are compelled to use, are but poles of the same thing-the terms are
relative. So with "East and West"—travel around the world in an
eastward direction, and you reach a point which is called west at your
starting point, and you return from that westward point. Travel far
enough North, and you will find yourself traveling South, or vice versa.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Light and Darkness are poles of the same thing, with many degrees
between them. The musical scale is the same—starting with "C" you move
upward until you reach another "C" and so on, the differences between
the two ends of the board being the same, with many degrees between the
two extremes. The scale of color is the same-higher and lower vibrations
being the only difference between high violet and low red. Large</p></div> </div>
