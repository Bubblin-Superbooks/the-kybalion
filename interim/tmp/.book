Contemporary with Abraham, and,\nif the legends be true, an instructor of that venerable sage, Hermes\nwas, and is, the Great Central Sun of Occultism, whose rays have served\nto illumine the countless teachings which have been promulgated since\nhis time.

Even the\nmost ancient teachings of India undoubtedly have their roots in the\noriginal Hermetic Teachings.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">From the land of the Ganges many advanced occultists wandered to the\nland of Egypt, and sat at the feet of the Master. From him they obtained\nthe Master-Key which explained and reconciled their divergent views, and\nthus the Secret Doctrine was firmly established. From other lands also\ncame the learned ones, all of whom regarded Hermes as the Master of\nMasters, and his influence was so great that in spite of the many\nwanderings from the path on the part of the centuries of teachers in\nthese different lands, there may still be found a certain basic\nresemblance and correspondence which underlies the many and often quite\ndivergent theories entertained and taught by the occultists of these\ndifferent lands today. The student of Comparative Religions will be able\nto perceive the</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">influence of the Hermetic Teachings in every religion\nworthy of the name, now known to man, whether it be a dead religion or\none in full vigor in our own times. There is always certain\ncorrespondence in spite of the contradictory features, and the Hermetic\nTeachings act as the Great Reconciler.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The lifework of Hermes seems to have been in the direction of planting\nthe great Seed-Truth which has grown and blossomed in so many strange\nforms, rather than to establish a school of philosophy which would\ndominate, the world's thought. But, nevertheless, the original truths\ntaught by him have been kept intact in their original purity by a few\nmen each age, who, refusing great numbers of half-developed students and\nfollowers, followed the Hermetic custom and reserved their truth for the\nfew who were ready to comprehend and master it. From lip to ear the\ntruth has been handed down among the few. There have always been a</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">few\nInitiates in each generation, in the various lands of the earth, who\nkept alive the sacred flame of the Hermetic Teachings, and such have\nalways been willing to use their lamps to re-light the lesser lamps of\nthe outside world, when the light of truth grew dim, and clouded by\nreason of neglect, and when the wicks became clogged with foreign\nmatter. There were always a few to tend faithfully the altar of the\nTruth, upon which was kept alight the Perpetual Lamp of Wisdom. These\nmen devoted their lives to the labor of love which the poet has so well\nstated in his lines:</p><p>\"O, let not the flame die out! Cherished age after age\nin its dark cavern—in its holy temples cherished. Fed\nby pure ministers of love—let not the flame die out!\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">These men have never sought popular approval, nor numbers of followers.\nThey are indifferent to these things, for they know how few there are in\neach generation who are ready for the truth, or who would</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">recognize it\nif it were presented to them. They reserve the \"strong meat for men,\"\nwhile others furnish the \"milk for babes.\" They reserve their pearls of\nwisdom for the few elect, who recognize their value and who wear them in\ntheir crowns, instead of casting them before the materialistic vulgar\nswine, who would trample them in the mud and mix them with their\ndisgusting mental food. But still these men have never forgotten or\noverlooked the original teachings of Hermes, regarding the passing on of\nthe words of truth to those ready to receive it, which teaching is\nstated in  as follows: \"Where fall the footsteps of the\nMaster, the ears of those ready for his Teaching open wide.\" And again:\n\"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to\nfill them with wisdom.\" But their customary attitude has always been\nstrictly in accordance with the other Hermetic aphorism, also in The\nKybalion: \"The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears</p>",

But a moment's glance back over the\npages of history will show the wisdom of the Masters, who knew the folly\nof attempting to teach to the world that which it was neither ready or\nwilling to receive. The Hermetists have never sought to be martyrs, and\nhave, instead, sat silently aside with a pitying smile on their closed\nlips, while the \"heathen raged noisily about them\" in their customary\namusement of putting to death and torture the honest but misguided\nenthusiasts who imagined that they could force upon a race of barbarians\nthe truth capable of being understood only by the elect who had advanced\nalong The Path.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And the spirit of persecution has not as yet died out in the land.

It also explains that\nall the phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE\nALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a\nwhole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the Mind of THE\nALL, in which Mind we \"live and move and have our being.\" This\nPrinciple, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily\nexplains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such\na large portion of the public attention, and which, without such\nexplanation, are non-understandable and defy scientific treatment.

With the Master-Key in his possession,\nthe student may unlock the many doors of the mental and psychic temple\nof knowledge, and enter the same freely and intelligently. This\nPrinciple explains the true nature of \"Energy,\" \"Power,\" and \"Matter,\"\nand why and how all these are subordinate to the Mastery of Mind. One of\nthe old Hermetic Masters wrote, long ages ago: \"He who grasps the truth\nof the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to\nMastery.\" And these words are as true today as at the time they were\nfirst written.

There are\nplanes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of\nCorrespondence to them we are able to understand much that would\notherwise be unknowable to us. This Principle is of universal\napplication and manifestation, on the various planes of the material,\nmental, and spiritual universe—it is an Universal Law. The ancient\nHermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental\ninstruments by which man was able</p>",

And\nyet this</p>",
  "page-34": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by\nthe Masters of Ancient Egypt. This Principle explains that the\ndifferences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind,\nand even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From\nTHE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all\nis in vibration—the higher the vibration, the higher the position in\nthe scale. The vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of\nintensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest—just as a rapidly\nmoving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale,\nthere are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem\nat rest. Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of\nvarying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and\nmolecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion.\nThis is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but\nvarying degrees of</p>",
  "page-35": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose\nstates depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes.\nAn understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas,\nenables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well\nas those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the\nconquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. \"He who understands\nthe Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of power,\" says one\nof the old writers.</p><ol><li>The Principle of Polarity\n\"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its\npair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are\nidentical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet;\nall truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be\nreconciled.\"—The Kybalion.</li></ol><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is</p>",
  "page-36": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">dual\"; \"everything\nhas two poles\"; \"everything has its pair of opposites,\" all of which\nwere old Hermetic axioms. It explains the old paradoxes, that have\nperplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: \"Thesis and\nantithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; \"opposites\nare the same, differing only in degree\"; \"the pairs of opposites may be\nreconciled\"; \"extremes meet\"; \"everything is and isn't, at the same\ntime\"; \"all truths are but half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\";\n\"there are two sides to everything,\" etc., etc., etc. It explains that\nin everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that\n\"opposites\" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with\nmany varying degrees between them. To illustrate:  Heat and Cold,\nalthough \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences\nconsisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer\nand see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\"</p>",
  "page-37": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">begins!\nThere is no such thing as \"absolute heat\" or \"absolute cold\"—the two\nterms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same\nthing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\"\nis merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. So \"heat\" and \"cold\"\nare simply the \"two poles\" of that which we call \"Heat\"—and the\nphenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of\nPolarity. The same Principle manifests in the case of \"Light and\nDarkness,\" which are the same thing, the difference consisting of\nvarying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does\n\"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between\n\"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"?\nBetween \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and\nLow\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity\nexplains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can</p>",
  "page-38": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">supersede it. The\nsame Principle operates on the Mental Plane. Let us take a radical and\nextreme example—that of \"Love and Hate,\" two mental states apparently\ntotally different.  And yet there are degrees of Hate and degrees of\nLove, and a middle point in which we use the terms \"Like or Dislike,\"\nwhich shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss\nto know whether we \"like\" or \"dislike\" or \"neither.\" And all are simply\ndegrees of the same thing, as you will see if you will but think a\nmoment.  And, more than this (and considered of more importance\nby the Hermetists), it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to\nthe vibrations of Love, in one's own mind, and in the minds of others.\nMany of you, who read these lines, have had personal experiences of the\ninvoluntary rapid transition from Love to Hate, and the reverse, in your\nown case and that of others.  And you will therefore realize the\npossibility of this being accomplished by the use of the</p>",
  "page-39": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Will, by means\nof the Hermetic formulas. \"Good and Evil\" are but the poles of the same\nthing, and the Hermetist understands the art of transmuting Evil into\nGood, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short,\nthe \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and\npracticed by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters.  An understanding\nof the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as\nthat of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master\nthe art.</p><ol><li>The Principle of Rhythm\n\"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides;\nall things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in\neverything; the measure of the swing to the right is the\nmeasure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.\"—The\nKybalion.</li></ol>",
  "page-40": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This Principle embodies the truth that in everything there is manifested\na measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and\nforward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide\nand low-tide; between the two poles which exist in accordance with the\nPrinciple of Polarity described a moment ago. There is always an action\nand a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This\nis in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind,\nenergy, and matter.  This law is manifest in the creation and\ndestruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the life of\nall things; and finally in the mental states of Man (and it is with this\nlatter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most\nimportant). The Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its\nuniversal application, and have also discovered certain means to\novercome its effects in themselves by the use</p>",
  "page-41": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">of the appropriate\nformulas and methods. They apply the Mental Law of Neutralization. They\ncannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they\nhave learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain\ndegree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle.  They have learned\nhow to USE it, instead of being USED BY it. In this and similar\nmethods, consist the Art of the Hermetists. The Master of Hermetics\npolarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then\nneutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which would tend to carry\nhim to the other pole.  All individuals who have attained any degree of\nSelf-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously,\nbut the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and\nattains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of\nbelief on the part of the masses who are swung backward and forward like\na pendulum.

The question\nis: \"WHY does THE ALL create Universes\" The question may be asked in\ndifferent forms, but the above is the gist of the inquiry.</p>",
  "page-114": "<p>Men have striven hard to answer this question, but still there is no\nanswer worthy of the name.

  "page-115": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">instinct\" would be the Absolute, instead of THE ALL, and so\naccordingly that part of the proposition falls.

And it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in some\ninfinite degree it must have what would correspond to an \"inner nature,\"\nor \"creative instinct,\" in man, with correspondingly infinite Desire and\nWill. It could not act unless it Willed to Act; and it would not Will to\nAct, unless it Desired to Act and it would not Desire to Act unless it\nobtained some Satisfaction thereby. And all of these things would belong\nto an \"Inner Nature,\" and might be postulated as existing according to\nthe Law of Correspondence.

So, you see, the matter is\nUnthinkable, just as THE ALL is Unknowable. Just as we say THE ALL\nmerely \"IS\"—so we are compelled to say that \"THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT\nACTS.\" At the last, THE ALL is All Reason in Itself; All Law in Itself;\nAll Action in Itself—and it may be said, truthfully, that THE ALL is\nIts Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act—or still further, that THE\nALL; Its Reason; Its Act; is Law; are ONE, all being names for the same\nthing.

While the purposes of this little book\ndo not allow us to enter into an extended discussion of, or explanation\nof, the subject of these different planes, still we think it well to\ngive a general description of the same at this point.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At the beginning we may as well consider the question so often asked by\nthe neophyte, who desires to be informed regarding the meaning of the\nword \"Plane\", which term has been very freely used, and very poorly\nexplained, in many recent works upon the subject of occultism. The\nquestion is generally about as follows: \"Is a Plane a place having\ndimensions, or is it merely a condition or state?\" We answer: \"No, not a\nplace, nor ordinary dimension of space; and yet more than a state or\ncondition. It may be considered as a state or condition, and yet the\nstate or condition is a degree of</p>",
  "page-123": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dimension, in a scale subject to\nmeasurement.\" Somewhat paradoxical, is it not? But let us examine the\nmatter. A \"dimension,\" you know, is \"a measure in a straight line,\nrelating to measure,\" etc. The ordinary dimensions of space are length,\nbreadth, and height, or perhaps length, breadth, height, thickness or\ncircumference. But there is another dimension of \"created things\" or\n\"measure in a straight line,\" known to occultists, and to scientists as\nwell, although the latter have not as yet applied the term \"dimension\"\nto it—and this new dimension, which, by the way, is the much speculated\n-about \"Fourth Dimension,\" is the standard used in determining the\ndegrees or \"planes.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This Fourth Dimension may be called \"The Dimension of Vibration\" It is a\nfact well known to modern science, as well as to the Hermetists who have\nembodied the truth in their \"Third Hermetic Principle,\" that \"everything\nis in motion; everything</p>",
  "page-124": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">vibrates; nothing is at rest.\"  From the\nhighest manifestation, to the lowest, everything and all things Vibrate.\nNot only do they vibrate at different rates of motion, but as in\ndifferent directions and in a different manner. The degrees of the rate\nof vibrations constitute the degrees of measurement on the Scale of\nVibrations—in other words the degrees of the Fourth Dimension. And\nthese degrees form what occultists call \"Planes\" The higher the degree\nof rate of vibration, the higher the plane, and the higher the\nmanifestation of Life occupying that plane. So that while a plane is not\n\"a place,\" nor yet \"a state or condition,\" yet it possesses qualities\ncommon to both. We shall have more to say regarding the subject of the\nscale of Vibrations in our next lessons, in which we shall consider the\nHermetic Principle of Vibration.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">You will kindly remember, however, that the Three Great Planes are not\nactual divisions of the phenomena</p>",

Be an object\ncold or hot—both being but degrees of the same things—it manifests\ncertain heat vibrations, and in that sense is in motion and vibration.\nThen all particles of Matter are in circular movement, from corpuscle to\nsuns. The planets revolve around suns, and many of them turn on their\naxes. The suns move around greater central points, and</p>",
  "page-148": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">these are\nbelieved to move around still greater, and so on, ad infinitum. The\nmolecules of which the particular kinds of Matter are composed are in a\nstate of constant vibration and movement around each other and against\neach other.

The atoms are composed of\nCorpuscles, sometimes called \"electrons,\" \"ions,\" etc., which also are\nin a state of rapid motion, revolving around each other, and which\nmanifest a very rapid state and mode of vibration. And, so we see that\nall forms of Matter manifest Vibration, in accordance with the Hermetic\nPrinciple of Vibration.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And so it is with the various forms of Energy. Science teaches that\nLight, Heat, Magnetism and Electricity are but forms of vibratory motion\nconnected in some way with, and probably emanating from the Ether.\nScience does not as yet attempt to explain the</p>",
  "page-149": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">nature of the phenomena\nknown as Cohesion, which is the principle of Molecular Attraction; nor\nChemical Affinity, which is the principle of Atomic Attraction; nor\nGravitation (the greatest mystery of the three), which is the principle\nof attraction by which every particle or mass of Matter is bound to\nevery other particle or mass.

  "page-150": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">elasticity, and pervades universal space,\nserving as a medium of transmission of waves of vibratory energy, such\nas heat, light, electricity, magnetism, etc. The Teachings are that The\nEthereal Substance is a connecting link between the forms of vibratory\nenergy known as \"Matter\" on the one hand, and \"Energy or Force\" on the\nother; and also that it manifests a degree of vibration, in rate and\nmode, entirely its own.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Scientists have offered the illustration of a rapidly moving wheel, top,\nor cylinder, to show the effects of increasing rates of vibration.

Let us suppose the object moving slowly.\nIt may be seen readily, but no sound of its movement reaches the ear.\nThe speed is gradually increased.

Then after quite a time\nthe eye catches a glimpse of the object becoming a dull dark reddish\ncolor. As the rate increases, the red becomes brighter.

  "page-164": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">is seen that the mental changes are\noccasioned by a change of polarity-a sliding along the same scale-the\nhatter is readily understood. The change is not in the nature of a\ntransmutation of one thing into another thing entirely different-but is\nmerely a change of degree in the same things, a vastly important\ndifference. For instance, borrowing an analogy from the Physical Plane,\nit is impossible to change Heat into Sharpness, Loudness, Highness,\netc., but Heat may readily be transmuted into Cold, simply by lowering\nthe vibrations. In the same way Hate and Love are mutually transmutable;\nso are Fear and Courage. But Fear cannot be transformed into Love, nor\ncan Courage be transmuted into Hate.

  "page-165": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the two poles may be classified\nas Positive and Negative, respectively. Thus Love is Positive to Hate;\nCourage to Fear; Activity to Non-Activity, etc., etc. And it will also\nbe noticed that even to those unfamiliar with the Principle of\nVibration, the Positive pole seems to be of a higher degree than the\nNegative, and readily dominates it.

  "page-212": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">likes,\ndislikes, habits, peculiar ties, characteristics, etc., all of which go\nto make up his personality, or the \"Self\" known to himself and others.\nHe knows that these emotions and feelings change; are born and die away;\nare subject to the Principle of Rhythm, and the Principle of Polarity,\nwhich take him from one extreme of feeling to another.

But if you will think\nof the matter in the light of the Hermetic Teachings you will be able to\nsee that the energizing of the Feminine Principle by the Vibratory\nEnergy of the Masculine Principle Is in accordance to the universal laws\nof nature, and that the natural world affords countless analogies\nwhereby the principle may be understood.

It is based\nupon true scientific principles. We have shown you that a mental state\nand its opposite were merely the two poles of one thing, and that by\nMental Transmutation the polarity might be reversed. This Principle is\nknown to modern psychologists, who apply it to the breaking up of\nundesirable habits by bidding their students concentrate upon the\nopposite quality. If you are possessed of Fear, do not waste time</p>",
  "page-231": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">trying\nto \"kill out\" Fear, but instead cultivate the quality of Courage, and\nthe Fear will disappear.

To kill out a\nNegative quality, concentrate upon the Positive Pole of that same\nquality, and the vibrations will gradually change from Negative to\nPositive, until finally you will become polarized on the\nPositive pole instead of the Negative. The reverse is also true, as many\nhave found out to their sorrow, when they have allowed themselves to\nvibrate too constantly on the Negative pole of things. By changing your\npolarity you may master your moods, change your mental states, remake\nyour disposition, and build up character.

Remember the\nHermetic Axiom (quoted previously), which says:</p><p>\"Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted\n   from state to state; degree to degree, condition to\n   condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration.\"—The Kybalion.</p><p>The mastery of Polarization is the mastery of the fundamental principles\nof Mental Transmutation or Mental Alchemy, for unless one acquires the\nart of changing his own polarity, he will be unable to affect his\nenvironment. An understanding of this principle will enable one to\nchange his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will but\ndevote the time, care, study and practice necessary to master the art.\nThe principle is true, but the results obtained depend upon the\npersistent patience and practice of the student.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Rhythm may be neutralized by an application of</p>",
  "page-233": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the Art\n   of Polarization.\"—The Kybalion.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As we have explained in previous chapters, the Hermetists hold that the\nPrinciple of Rhythm manifests on the Mental Plane as well as on the\nPhysical Plane, and that the bewildering succession of moods, feelings,\nemotions, and other mental states, are due to the backward and forward\nswing of the mental pendulum, which carries us from one extreme of\nfeeling to the other. The Hermetists also teach that the Law of\nNeutralization enables one, to a great extent, to overcome the operation\nof Rhythm in consciousness. As we have explained, there is a Higher\nPlane of Consciousness, as well as the ordinary Lower Plane, and the\nMaster by rising mentally to the Higher Plane causes the swing of the\nmental pendulum to manifest on the Lower Plane, and he, dwelling on his\nHigher Plane, escapes the consciousness of the swing backward. This is\neffected by polarizing on the Higher Self, and thus</p>",
  "page-234": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">raising the mental\nvibrations of the Ego above those of the ordinary plane of\nconsciousness. It is akin to rising above a thing and allowing it to\npass beneath you.

This is accomplished by all\nindividuals who have attained any degree of self-mastery, whether\nthey understand the law or not. Such persons simply \"refuse\" to allow\nthemselves to be swung back by the pendulum of mood and emotion, and by\nsteadfastly affirming the superiority they remain polarized on the\nPositive pole.

  "page-236": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">By an understanding of the practice of Polarization, the Hermetists rise\nto a higher plane of Causation and thus counter-balance the laws of the\nlower planes of Causation.

By being able to master their own moods and feelings, and by\nbeing able to neutralize Rhythm, as we have already explained, they are\nable to escape a great part of the operations of Cause and Effect on the\nordinary plane. The masses of people are carried along, obedient to\ntheir environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than\nthemselves; the effects of inherited tendencies; the suggestions of\nthose about them; and other outward causes; which tend to move them\nabout on the chess-board of life like mere pawns.

  "page-237": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and\nfeelings, they create for themselves new characters, qualities and\npowers, by which they overcome their ordinary environment, and thus\nbecome practically players instead of mere Pawns. Such people help to\nplay the game of life understandingly, instead of being moved about this\nway and that way by stronger influences and powers and wills. They use\nthe Principle of Cause and Effect, instead of being used by\nit. Of course, even the highest are subject to the Principle as it\nmanifests on the higher planes, but on the lower planes of activity,\nthey are Masters instead of Slaves. As The Kybalion says:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"The wise ones serve on the higher, but rule on the lower.\n   They obey the laws coming from above them, But on their\n   own plane, and those below them they rule and give orders.\n   And, yet, in so doing, they form a part of the Principle,\n   instead of opposing it. The wise man falls in with the Law,\n   and by understanding its</p>",
  "page-238": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">movements he operates it instead\n   of being its blind slave. Just as does the skilled swimmer\n   turn this way and that way, going and coming as he will,\n   instead of being as the log which is carried here and\n   there—so is the wise man as compared to the ordinary\n   man—and yet both swimmer and log; wise man and fool,\n   are subject to Law. He who understands this is well on\n   the road to Mastery.\"—The Kybalion.</p><p>In conclusion let us again call your attention to the Hermetic Axiom:</p><p>\"True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art.\"—The Kybalion.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the above axiom, the Hermetists teach that the great work of\ninfluencing one's environment is accomplished by Mental Power.
